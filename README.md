Welcome to my portfolio website! This project is a _100% original design_ created using Figma. I coded it from scratch using React, TypeScript and Tailwind. I made minimal use of UI libraries to showcase my coding skills.

Skills, language & tech I learned during the project development:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Figma

I worked on this project in my spare time, and I am proud to present it as a demonstration of my abilities. In the future, I plan to add a built-in blog using a headless CMS.

Thank you for visiting my website! If you found any bugs or if you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my work!
