While a common solution is to use an inexpensive API, I discovered that it is more effective to introduce a smart mechanism into the front-end implementation which functions as a soft stopgap from an extensive execution of external API services successively. By implementing such into my work, I managed to reduce the operational cost while still being able to deliver a decent user experience as the designer envisioned without any significant trade-offs.",

So, I designed and implemented a mechanism on the front-end development side where it only executes the API request once the user has completed (paused once a significant keyword has been typed) their typing action. By implementing such, the cost was reduced up to 87% without noticeably compromising any of the user experience as we monitored." },

Based on the user's behaviour predictions, I developed a mechanism that only updates the database only once the user has finished their actions. This was implemented in the user's favourites, likes, bookmarks, and other similar features. It results in reducing approximately 3 times the normal server traffic." },

As an engineer, I utilise my skill of creative problem-solving and helped the company to design and develop a low-cost yet efficient system architecture suited to its needs. During my involvement in developing a sports facility booking system with built-in social features, I engineered a hybrid database system (SQL and NoSQL) which caters to its use cases. The design is only suited for this project due to its nature; as reading the database is more prominent while a frequent update to the database is expected." },

From my experience, there is always a psychological pattern in customers‚Äô behaviour. I put the effort into the details of every design and its development process.
